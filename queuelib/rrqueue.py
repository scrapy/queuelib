class RoundRobinQueue:
    """A round robin queue implemented using multiple internal queues (typically,
    FIFO queues). The internal queue must implement the following methods:
        * push(obj)
        * pop()
        * peek()
        * close()
        * __len__()
    The constructor receives a qfactory argument, which is a callable used to
    instantiate a new (internal) queue when a new key is allocated. The
    qfactory function is called with the key number as first and only
    argument.
    start_keys is a sequence of domains to start with. If the queue was
    previously closed leaving some domain buckets non-empty, those domains
    should be passed in start_keys.

    The queue maintains a fifo queue of keys.  The key that went last is
    poped first and the next queue for that key is then poped.  This allows
    for a round robin
